# There is a file called interests.txt which contains a paragraph of a university applicant's goals for applying.
# Write code that would read in the paragraph into a string
# (you can assume the file exists in the same folder as the python program).
# Print out the longest and the shortest words in that paragraph, along with the length of those words.
# If there is a tie, you can pick 1 word.
